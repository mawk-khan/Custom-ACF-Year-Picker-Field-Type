/**
 * Include the Custom ACF Year Picker Field Type
 *
 * This line includes the 'acf-year-picker.php' file, which contains the definition of a custom
 * ACF field type named 'Year Picker'. The 'Year Picker' field type extends the functionality of
 * Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) by adding a field that allows users to select a year from a dropdown.
 * This is particularly useful for date-related data where only the year is relevant.
 *
 * The 'acf-year-picker.php' file defines the 'acf_field_year_picker' class, which handles the
 * rendering, functionality, and script/style enqueuing for this custom field type.
